## Features
Word Guessing: Try to guess the word correctly within a limited number of attempts.

Hangman Art: As you make incorrect guesses, a hangman ASCII art is displayed to indicate the number of turns left.

Player Records: Your game results, whether you win or lose, are saved in an Excel workbook.

## Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer. If not, you can download and install it from the official Python website.

## Usage
Run the Hangman game by executing the hangman.py file in your Python environment.

The game will select a word from a predefined list, and you'll have 10 chances to guess the word.

Make guesses one letter at a time, and the game will provide feedback.

If you guess the entire word, you win! Your result will be recorded.

If you run out of turns, the hangman's fate is sealed, and you'll be recorded as a loser.

## Results Tracking
The Hangman game keeps a record of player results in an Excel workbook. The file is created at the specified path or used if it already exists. The results include the player's name and whether they won or lost.

## Player's Experience
